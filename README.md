I'm physicist at (UNESP) and I have some experiences in oilfield as 'data operator', where I worked as mlwd (monitoring real data from drilling field). I have learned to adapt quickly with new technologies, solving problem in high pressure environments. I combine analytical and soft skills. I learning and improve my knowledges on Artificial Inteligence, Machine Learning, Deep learning, Big Data analysis to solve real problems on my master thesis, I developed a critical thinking and problems.
